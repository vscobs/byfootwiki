Regions are classified using a code consisting of four categories: **Temperature** and **Precipitation**, **Altitude**, **Continentality** and **Drainage**.
## Seasonal Weather
The first two blocks represent Winter and Summer. Each contains two digits: the first for Temperature and the second for Precipitation. Both are measured on a scale of 1 to 5.
## Altitude
The final segment denotes the general elevation of the region:
- HL (Highlands): Peaks, ridges, and steep inclines.
- ML (Midlands): Rolling hills and plateaued steps.
- LL (Lowlands): Plains, basins, and valley floors.
## Continentality
This indicates how the local climate is regulated by large bodies of water:
- CS (Coastal): Mild temperature swings and higher humidity.
- CT (Continental): Sharp temperature changes between day and night or season to season.
## Drainage
Drainage determines how the ground handles water:
- GD (Good Drainage): Releases water faster than it accumulates: firm soil, few marshes, and quick runoff after rain.
- PD (Poor Drainage): Accumulates water faster than it releases: prone to bogs, standing water, and muddy trails.
## Example
If you encounter the code **24 41 LL CS GD**, it means that the region has **cold and wet winters**, **hot and dry summers**, is **near sea-level in elevation**, **coastal**, and has **good soil drainage**.

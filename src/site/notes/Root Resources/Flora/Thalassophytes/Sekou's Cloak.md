Sekou’s cloak is a rare flowering lithophyte native to the northern shores of [[Geography/Stemarcrusia\|Stemarcrusia]], found exclusively on tidal rocks exposed to both heavy wave action and periods of desiccation.
# Etymology
Not specified.
# Morphology
The plant forms a low, mat-like structure over bare stone. The foliage is a light bluish-green. Once a year, it produces clustered, wide white flowers with inner black halos, followed by small white spherical berries.
# Physiology
Leaves spread tightly against the surface to resist wave drag.
## Mechanisms
Salt is excreted through specialized glands. The fruits contain a secretion that is toxic to cansbiah and humans but safely digested by [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Atimis\|atimises]]. Roots secrete a binding mucilage to anchor into rock crevices.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
A perennial species, Sekou’s cloaks can live up to 20 years. Seeds are capable of floating for over a month.
# Ecology
It thrives in an ecological niche defined by alternating immersion in brackish seawater and direct air exposure. Pollination is carried by both wind and water.

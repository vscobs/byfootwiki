The Coan-Schell seacandle is a deep-water marine plant found along nutrient-rich and cold ocean currents in [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan-Schell]]. Preferring stable, low-light environments of the sublittoral zone, it thrives in dense colonies.
# Etymology
From English *sea* + *candle*.
# Morphology
The plant grows upright in a candle-like shape, its smooth, waxy surface a deep green. Along its stem, it produces gas-filled spherical “seacandle bubbles” ranging from four to twenty centimeters in radius.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
The bubbles store and release oxygen to surrounding water, reduce current stress, and possibly aid photosynthesis by scattering dim light.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It produces no flowers, reproducing solely through vegetative propagation by sending new shoots from the base. Individual plants can persist for several decades.
## Social Structure
They form a web-like network of interconnected roots, resembling a family unit.
# Ecology
Small fish often shelter among the bubbles, while microbial communities and algae-like fungi cling to the surface. The dense mat of interconnected plants forms a resilient network.

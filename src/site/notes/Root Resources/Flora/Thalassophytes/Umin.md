Endemic to the tidal shores of the [[Geography/Zones/Nusaran Sandstone Caves\|Nusaran Sandstone Caves]], the umin (or seaballoon) is a resilient coastal plant adapted to the interplay of sand, salt, and stone. Known locally for the buoyant, air-filled shape of its fruit, the shrub is a vital part of the local cave-beach ecosystem.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The umin shrub grows low and laterally. From late Summer through early Winter, the plant produces orange flowers directly in the shallows, often half-submerged. The fruit are large, light green, cylindrical capsules filled with airy pulp and clusters of soft seeds. These balloon-like fruits bob lightly on waves.
# Physiology
The roots stabilize the plant against waves and erosion while reaching down to mineral-rich sublayers.
## Mechanisms
Fruits are buoyant to aid in dispersal. Germination is triggered by alternating cycles of wetting and drying.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Young shrubs quickly develop a deep, tenacious root system.
# Ecology
The umin’s life cycle is intimately tied to the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Sandstone Cansbiah\|sandstone cansbiah]], which feeds on both flowers and fruit and aids in pollination and seed dispersal.

A fast-spreading, heat-tolerant flowering moss that pioneers bare rock and thin soils across [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]]’s plains. Pebblepip is a foundational groundcover that provides early biomass.
# Etymology
From English *pebble* + *pip*.
# Morphology
Dense mats of dark-red vegetative growth no taller than ~80 mm, dotted with tiny upright white flowers that look like little spikes or “pips.” The groundcover has a fine, velvety texture when mature.
# Physiology
Heat-tolerant pioneer species.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Rapid vegetative expansion via rhizoids and spore/flower production during moist periods. Short-lived shoots renew annually.
# Ecology
Thrives after disturbance or in mineral-rich micro-sites. Mats thicken over years and seed/propagule banks in soil pockets allow quick recolonization after [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]] dieback.

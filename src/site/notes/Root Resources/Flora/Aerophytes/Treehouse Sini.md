Treehouse sini are fast-growing, woody aerophytes that thrive throughout [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]’s forests, often establishing themselves on the branches and trunks of host trees. Unlike [[Root Resources/Flora/Aerophytes/Helix Sini\|helix sini]], treehouse sini aggressively colonize their environment, capable of spreading indefinitely if unchecked. Their tangled, semi-woody stems form intricate canopy-like structures that provide habitat for finbirds and other small species, while simultaneously competing with their host trees for sunlight and nutrients.
# Etymology
From English *treehouse* and *sini*, of unknown origin.
# Morphology
Treehouse sini stems are darker than those of [[Root Resources/Flora/Aerophytes/Helix Sini\|helix sini]], with older branches becoming smaller and semi-woody while younger growth remains flexible. The plant produces small leaves primarily at stem tips, while the main canopy-like structures remain mostly leafless, maximizing space for nests and perching. Flowers are arranged in shorter catkin structures than [[Root Resources/Flora/Aerophytes/Helix Sini\|helix sini]], with paler and darker shades appearing across different catkins.
# Physiology
Each catkin produces highly fragrant, nectar-rich blossoms that attract numerous insect pollinators, enabling the plant to reproduce rapidly and continuously.
## Specific Abilities
Treehouse sini grow extremely fast, adding 180–250 cm of length each year. While largely dependent on host trees for structural support, treehouse sini can overwhelm their hosts, covering leaves and branches and sometimes killing the tree through nutrient depletion and light obstruction.
# Ecology
Reproduction is continuous, with catkins producing nectar year-round and gradually maturing seeds dispersed by insects and occasional animals. Treehouse sini serve as both habitat and food source in their forests. Their nectar supports a wide range of insects, which in turn pollinate the flowers, while finbirds and other small species use the tangled stems for nesting and shelter. The plant is also a food source for a large herbivorous mammal native to the forest, which helps control its spread. Despite its aggressive tendencies, treehouse sini form a key part of forest ecology, shaping the structure of tree canopies and the distribution of forest-dwelling species.

Helix sini are long-lived, woody liana-like aerophytes that grow hanging from the upper parts of the [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helices]]. They establish themselves when rain softens the nutrient-rich interior of the [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helix]], allowing small seeds to root and take advantage of the abundant minerals. Over decades, helix sini form thick, twisting stems that reach impressive lengths, providing vertical structure in the skies of the Schell Archipelago.
# Etymology
From English *helix* and *sini*, of unknown origin.
# Morphology
Helix sini stems are pale, almost white, blending discreetly against the walls of the [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helices]]. Mature branches can reach 10–15 cm in thickness and are semi-woody, becoming fully woody with age. The plant produces thick, rough-textured leaves near stem tips and around flowering structures; these leaves store water and resist wind and environmental stress. Helix Sini flowers form in long, hanging catkins about 12 cm long, each covered in tiny fuchsia or royal purple blossoms roughly 0.5 cm across. The flowers can be stimulated to produce more nectar if the nectar is quickly overconsumed.
# Physiology
The catkins remain flowering for up to a year and a half in safe environments, gradually developing seeds that crawl down the structure as they mature.
## Mechanism
Seeds are lightweight, with feathery extensions that allow them to drift on upward winds, finding new [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helices]] to colonize. Roots adapt to available surfaces: when the [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helix]] interior is soft, roots penetrate directly; when surfaces are too hard, they grow along cracks, anchor around exposed filaments, or send adhesive rootlets to secure themselves externally.
# Ecology
Helix sini grow steadily at around 50–80 cm per year. They are evergreen and do not have seasonal cycles for flowering. Reproduction occurs via the catkin flowers, which attract pollinators such as [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Xylofeatherfly\|xylofeatherflies]] and crawling insects. Seeds are dispersed by both wind and animal activity. Helix sini support unique shelled land-marine animals, which remain nearly stationary atop the catkins to feed on nectar, and help structure finbird nests in their tangled upper branches. Helix sini serve as crucial habitat engineers in [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Schell/Schell\|Schell]]. They provide shelter and nesting opportunities for both birds and small shelled animals, while offering pollinators a long-term source of nectar.

The linavolna is a creeping herbaceous plant. It is a common sight in harsher, windy regions of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]], where its low profile allows it to thrive where upright plants would snap.
# Etymology
From Latin *linea* (“line, thread”) + *vulnus* (“wound, injury”).
# Morphology
The plant consists of a single, thick, crawling "spine" that extends horizontally across the soil, reaching lengths of up to a few meters. Along the top of this spine, a single, disciplined line of minuscule yellow flowers blooms.
# Physiology
It anchors itself with strong adventitious roots.
## Mechanisms
The yellow flowers turn into tiny, sticky burrs that latch onto passing animals for dispersal. It is highly resistant to trampling and wind.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Not specified.
## Social Structure
Not specified.
# Ecology
The linavolna is a pioneer species, often the first to colonize loose rocky soil or landslide areas.

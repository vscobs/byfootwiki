The mentabrech is a tall grass species found in the humid lands and riverbanks of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]]. It is valued locally for its intense aromatic properties.

It is fast-growing.
## Mechanisms
When crushed or bruised, the blades release a potent, tangy scent reminiscent of sharp mint and brine. This aromatic property serves as a defense mechanism that deters most herbivores.

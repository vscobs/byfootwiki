The sienerie is a fast-colonizing flowering plant that transforms open ground into pale, shimmering expanses. Though individually delicate in appearance, the sienerie functions as a dominant spatial organizer wherever soils are shallow and disturbance is frequent.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The plant grows on thin but resilient stems branching in loose sprays (up to 2m). Each stem terminates in a compact, spherical inflorescence of minute white flowers. Below ground, sieneries develop shallow yet extremely wide root networks spreading laterally far beyond the visible canopy.
# Physiology
Leaves are minimal and short-lived to reduce water loss.
## Mechanisms
It exhibits partial clonal reinforcement: lateral root nodes can generate new shoots when buried or damaged, allowing regeneration after trampling.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Reproductive success is driven by massive seed output combined with rapid generational turnover. Germination is fast and opportunistic.
## Social Structure
Dense sienerie stands suppress slower-growing competitors through sheer spatial occupation.
# Ecology
The plant stabilizes loose soils while maintaining a short-lived but self-renewing dominance. Seeds are adapted for short-range wind dispersal.

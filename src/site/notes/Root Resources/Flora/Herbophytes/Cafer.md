Cafers are small, moisture-loving herbaceous flowers found primarily in microhabitat of [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]], often near [[Root Resources/Fungi/Giant Hupsaja\|giant hupsaja]] or small streams.
# Etymology
Not specified.
# Morphology
Cafer forms compact clusters of tiny tubular flowers that grow upward. Flower colors range from deep brick-reds to bright oranges, depending on microhabitat and sun exposure. Leaves are small and arranged to maximize access to moisture from surrounding humidity.
# Physiology
Thrives where water collects in rock crevices or along [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]-rich runoff zones.
## Mechanisms
Its slight cafrite absorption renders it mildly toxic, allowing it to survive in chemically hostile environments.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Cafers have a short, seasonal life cycle: it grows, blooms, and dies within a single season. Reproduction occurs via both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation.
# Ecology
Flowers emit a faint fragrance to attract pollinators, particularly [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Esgaian Featherfly\|Esgaian featherflies]]. The plant thrives only in consistently moist areas and dies when the seasonal humidity diminishes.

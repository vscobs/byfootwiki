The Tirsian foreoflower is an herbaceous plant native to the interior valleys and high cliffs of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]].

# Etymology
Uncertain.
# Morphology
The plant features a central, rigid stalk rising 40 to 50 centimeters. The bloom sits atop this stalk in a complex, cup-like formation resembling a crown. The petals are a deep, velvety indigo with distinct silver edges. The leaves are broad and dark green, arranged in a basal rosette to maximize moisture retention.
# Physiology
Adapted to maximize moisture retention in valley mists.
## Mechanisms
The crown of petals shifts orientation to follow the path of the moon. The silver edges of the petals reflect moonlight to attract pollinators.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
This perennial plant blooms in mid-summer.
# Ecology
It is pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects attracted to the silver reflection of its petals under moonlight.

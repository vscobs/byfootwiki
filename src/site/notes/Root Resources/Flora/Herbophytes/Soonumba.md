The soonumba is a creeping herbaceous plant native to northeastern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. It grows in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils, often at the base of [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Suntower\|suntowers]] or climbing their trunks.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Soonumba stems are slender and flexible. Blossoms are arranged in double whorls: an upper ring of six lilac to royal purple flowers, and a lower ring of six darker blossoms. Each flower releases a distinct earthy-green fragrance. Fertilized flowers produce compound berries containing hard seeds.
# Physiology
Long-lived for an herb, reaching 8–12 years.
## Mechanisms
Stems produce a clear glue-like secretion that allows them to attach to bark or stone. Berries are coated in a diluted variant of this sticky substance, enabling dispersal by adhesion or ingestion.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The plant blooms once a year in late February.
## Social Structure
Colonies spread widely across rocks and tree surfaces.
# Ecology
Pollinators include [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Sungel Featherfly\|sungel featherflies]] and [[Root Resources/Fauna/Pinnavians/Northeastern Esgaia Dwarf Finbird\|northeastern Esgaia dwarf finbirds]]. The sticky coating allows seeds to be dispersed by dwarf finbirds (via ingestion) or accidental adhesion to larger animals. The stickiness poses a hazard to smaller featherflies.

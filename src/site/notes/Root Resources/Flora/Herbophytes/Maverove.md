The maverove is a common herbaceous weed widespread across northeastern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. While abundant, it is ecologically minor compared to keystone plants.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Maverove stems are thin, upright, and weakly branching, averaging 25–40 cm in height. Flowers occur in flat-plane arrangements, each cluster composed of dozens of tiny orange blossoms with five bulbous white anthers. Seed capsules are small and dry.
# Physiology
Not specified.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The species is short-lived and opportunistic, completing its life cycle in under a year. It germinates quickly in autumn or spring, blooms within weeks, and sets seed by early summer.
# Ecology
It thrives in disturbed soils, open plains, and along the bases of larger plants. Seeds disperse by wind. Its rapid growth makes it common in fallow fields or areas of frequent soil turnover.

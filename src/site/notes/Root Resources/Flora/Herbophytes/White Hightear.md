The white hightear is a resilient herbaceous plant native to the cold, transitional zones of [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/Cretta/Cretta\|Cretta]] and the lower slopes of the [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/Rigus Crown\|Rigus Crown]], both in [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/East Nua\|East Nua]]. Adapted to frigid winds, it is easily recognized by its unique reproductive structure, which prioritizes thermal retention.
# Etymology
From English *white* and *high* + *tear*.
# Morphology
The plant reaches a height of 60 cm. Its foliage is characterized by specially wide, sturdy leaves covered in thin microscopic hairs. The reproductive head features an inverted teardrop arrangement formed by two layers of waxy gray-blue petals.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
Microscopic hairs on leaves reduce moisture loss and insulate against frost. The petals open only slightly, creating a nearly sealed chamber that preserves internal warmth for the developing ovary.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It employs a dual reproductive strategy: local clonal spreading and sexual reproduction via pollination.
## Social Structure
Creates clonal colonies that function as a single organism.
# Ecology
It relies on featherflies for pollination and on roaming herbivores for seed dispersal. The fruit is highly nutritious, serving as a calorie-dense resource for local wildlife.

The roscourd is a showy, nectar-bearing flower that gives its name to the region where it is most abundant. Growing in dense stands across northeastern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]], it plays a foundational ecological role as the primary nectar source for couredew featherflies, petalden mites, and the dwarf finbird.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Each roscourd produces a single flower on a solitary, upright stem, reaching a height of about 60 cm. The bloom is heart-shaped due to a pair of fused sepals that enclose the reproductive structures; the species produces no true petals. The sepals are thickly pigmented, ranging from pinkish red to deep magenta or blood-red.
# Physiology
Produces abundant nectar and pollen.
## Mechanisms
Stems are covered with fine, penetrating hairs that deter handling.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The plant is biennial. In the first year, seedlings establish. They bloom in late winter, shed sepals, and enter dormancy through summer/autumn. In the second late winter, they bloom again to produce seed pods, then die by the following autumn.
## Social Structure
Grows in dense stands.
# Ecology
The plant creates a distinctive seasonal landscape. It provides husks and root matter that enrich the soil and provide food for detritivores after death.

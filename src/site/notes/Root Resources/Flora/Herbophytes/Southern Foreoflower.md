The southern foreoflower inhabits the humid, coastal lowlands of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Coultfale/Coultfale\|Coultfale]] and [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Berra/Berra\|Berra]]. Unlike its highland cousin, this species has adapted to the salt spray and intense coastal sun of western [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]].
# Etymology
Uncertain.
# Morphology
This species is shorter and bushier than the [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Tirsian Foreoflower\|Tirsian]] variety, growing in dense clusters to resist wind damage. Its petals are broader and lighter in color, ranging from pale lavender to near-white. The stalk is thicker and more fibrous, allowing it to bend without breaking in coastal gales.
# Physiology
Highly salt-tolerant.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The southern foreoflower blooms in late spring.
# Ecology
It plays a minor role in stabilizing the soil in the damp lowlands of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Berra/Berra\|Berra]].

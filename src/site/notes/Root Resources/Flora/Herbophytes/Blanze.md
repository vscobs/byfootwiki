Blanze is a short, sturdy flowering plant native to the rocky plains of [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]]. It occupies harsh, [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]-exposed habitats where only resilient flora can survive.
# Etymology
Not specified.
# Morphology
Blanze grows to a total height of ~30 cm, producing a single large flower approximately 12 cm wide atop a thick, rough-textured stem. The flower has 6 triangular white petals and 6 smaller pale-yellow sepals. The plant’s sturdy, rough stem supports its heavy flower in windy or exposed terrain.
# Physiology
It tolerates high humidity and [[Environmental Phenomena/Cafrite Efflux\|cafrite vapors]].
## Mechanisms
Its tissues absorb some [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]], making it slightly toxic to herbivores.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Blanze blooms once a year at the end of May and completes its life cycle after producing two flowers in total. The plant is semelparous; after its second bloom, the plant dies.
# Ecology
Its fragrance is very strong, designed to draw [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Esgaian Featherfly\|Esgaian featherflies]] and other local pollinators in a sparse environment. It relies heavily on pollinators for fertilization.

The aroma saxatile, often called "saxatile," is an evergreen tree renowned for its spicy, salty roots that thrive in rocky, exposed landscapes where few other trees survive.
# Etymology
From Latin *arōma* ("spice, fragrance, odor") + *saxatilis* ("of or pertaining to rocks”).
# Morphology
The aroma saxatile is an evergreen tree that grows up to 30 meters tall, with dark grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves densely clustered along its branches. In late summer, peach-colored, bell-shaped flowers bloom for two weeks. Its thick, aromatic roots penetrate rocky soils.
# Physiology
Roots are spicy, salty, and aromatic.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It can live for over a century. Wind-pollinated flowers develop into small, rare, spherical fruits.
# Ecology
Seeds dispersed by weathering germinate in crevices, sustained by the tree's resilient roots.

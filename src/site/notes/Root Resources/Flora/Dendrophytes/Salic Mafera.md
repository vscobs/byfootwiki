The salic mafera is a towering relative of the common [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Mafera\|mafera]]. Unlike its [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]-adapted cousin, it thrives in the soils of southwestern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]] rather than [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]]’s rocky, mineral-rich terrain.
# Etymology
From Latin *salix* (“willow”) and from proto-Esgaian *ma-* (“fruit”).
# Morphology
The salic mafera reaches heights of twenty to thirty meters. It has a flat canopy with larger, drooping branches. Its trunk grows more upright. The bark is rough and dark, lacking the aromatic inner layers of its cafrite-adapted relative. Leaves are larger, lighter in color, and less waxy than the common mafera. Flowers are large, though few develop into fruit. Salic maferfruit are smaller than common maferfruit, with dry, bitter flesh.
# Physiology
Does not generate the prized cafer-mafer spice due to the absence of cafrite in its environment.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
In ideal conditions, salic maferas can live for well over a century.
## Social Structure
Ethereal presence and flowing canopy make it a favored habitat.
# Ecology
Its drooping branches and expansive canopy provide nesting sites for [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Esgaian Featherfly\|Esgaian featherflies]], which in turn assist in pollination and propagation. Propagation is aided by featherfly activity.

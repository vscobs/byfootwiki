The common ambrebule is found on the south and west of the continent of [[Geography/Marcrusia\|Marcrusia]].
# Etymology
From Arabic *عنبر* (*ʕanbar*, “amber”) + Latin *bulla* (“bubble, knob”).
# Morphology
The ambrebule grows no taller than 4 meters, with a flattened, wide canopy. Its bark is dark and chocolate-colored, rough, hard, and deeply textured. The leaves are small, tough, and densely packed. In spring, the tree is dotted with tiny white flowers that bloom singly along its branches. Each flower produces a small, dry seed pod containing a single seed.
# Physiology
Produces a secretion that hardens into bules (hardened resin spheres).
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The ambrebule flowers in late spring, with blossoms emerging in April and persisting through May. After flowering, the tree begins secreting the bules along its bark and harden over the course of three to four weeks. The tree lives from 40 to 50 years.
## Social Structure
Solitary nature; most ambrebules grow far apart unless cultivated.
# Ecology
Natural propagation is difficult due to the low germination rate.

The alimavir is a tall deciduous tree with flowy, lightweight gray-green leaves known for its fabric products.
# Etymology
From Hebrew *עלים* (*alím*, “leaves”) + *אוויר* (*avír*, "air").
# Morphology
The alimavir tree grows up to 15 meters tall, with a spreading canopy of its broad, resistant leaves that reach about 40 centimeters in height and width. Its flowers come in catkins that grow between 8 and 14 centimeters.
# Physiology
Leaves are resistant.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The trees live for several decades, usually 5 or 6 in the wild, more if in captivity. Its catkins begin growing in mid-summer until they reach maturity and fly off in early fall.
# Ecology
The alimavir relies on wind propagation to reproduce, efficiently spreading its seeds.

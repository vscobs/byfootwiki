The ocskie tree produces distinctive yellow-green fruits with a tangy, floral taste. It inhabits southern [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/East Nua\|East Nua]].

# Morphology
The ocskie tree stands about 8 meters tall, with twisting branches and orange-brown leaves. In late spring, it blooms with small white flowers. The fruit is ovoid, growing between 3 and 5 centimeters in height, with smooth pale skin.

The mafera is a low, broad tree uniquely adapted to the [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]-laden soils of [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]]. Its gnarled, sprawling form and powerful roots allow it to survive in rocky terrain where few other trees endure.
# Etymology
From proto-Esgaian *ma-* (“fruit”).
# Morphology
The tree grows between three and five meters, with a flat, full canopy. Massive, thick roots often break visibly through rock surfaces. The outer bark is heavily textured and almost gray-brown, while the inner bark is lighter. Scraping the inner bark releases the fine, dark spice, cafer-mafer. The leaves are dark green, sturdy, and slightly waxy. Tiny white flowers give way to cylindrical fruits called maferfruit with tough yellow skin and dry, bitter flesh.
# Physiology
The tree produces a dark, aromatic powder in its inner bark—a prized spice known as cafer-mafer—resulting from its ability to absorb and detoxify cafrite. This chemical adaptation protects the tree from decay and herbivores.
## Mechanisms
Cafrite is bound within woody fibers, neutralizing toxicity.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Not specified.
# Ecology
The mafera thrives by anchoring itself in mineral-rich soils and drawing [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]] into its tissues. Its fruit is pollinated by [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Families/Featherfly (Ptilopteridae)\|featherflies]] and other local insects.

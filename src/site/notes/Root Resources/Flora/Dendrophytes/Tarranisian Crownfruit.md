The Tarranisian crownfruit tree is a species found only within [[Geography/Icosachores/TARRAN/Tarran\|Tarran]]. It plays an important role in both ecology and daily life.
# Etymology
From Tarran + *-isian* and English *crown* + *fruit*.
# Morphology
The tree reaches up to 8 meters in height with a sturdy 1-meter-thick trunk. Its bark is dark orange-yellow. The tree’s pale green leaves are thin, lightweight, and elongated, creating a light canopy. In early April, bell-shaped flowers emerge, white to pale orange, with a musk and metal fragrance. By late July to early August, blooms give way to the namesake crownfruits: orange, up to 15 centimeters tall, with an upside-down flame-like form capped with six curved, spiny extremities.
# Physiology
Roots are thin, extremely long, and water-hungry.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The crownfruit tree is fast-growing but short-lived, typically surviving only 8 to 12 years. It begins to bear fruit early, around its fourth or fifth year.
## Social Structure
The tree persists in its native habitats through rapid renewal, creating small but enduring groves.
# Ecology
Pollination depends on local fauna such as the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Sungel Featherfly\|sungel featherfly]], [[Root Resources/Fauna/Pinnavians/Sungel Finbird\|sungel finbird]], and [[Root Resources/Fauna/Reptiles/Clay Nuprae\|clay nuprae]]. Reproduction is seed-based, with dispersal occurring as animals consume and spread the fruits.

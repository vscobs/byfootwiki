The suntower is a tall evergreen tree found across sparse forests and occasionally in plains. It is dioecious, with male and female individuals producing distinct reproductive structures.
# Etymology
From English *sun* + *tower*.
# Morphology
Mature trees usually reach 16–20 meters. The bark is pale yellow-brown, soft and malleable but resistant. Leaves are evergreen, thick, lightweight, and white year-round, forming an elongated canopy. The tree produces small clusters of yellow flowers with a purple-black gradient.
# Physiology
Leaves are resistant to weathering.
## Mechanisms
Female trees produce small, spherical white seed pods containing elongated blackish-brown seeds. The pods secrete a fragrant sticky liquid.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Suntowers take 8–9 years to reach maturity and live up to two centuries. Flowering occurs year-round. Seed pods mature over 6–7 months before falling.
## Social Structure
Suntowers are highly competitive for light, forming tall canopies that overshadow nearby vegetation.
# Ecology
Attracts pollinators such as the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Sungel Featherfly\|sungel featherfly]]. Seed dispersal is carried out by seed-eating animals. Nectar and pollen from male flowers are collected by featherflies as a key ingredient for sungel.

The Tirsian woodpod is endemic to [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Tirsa Valley/Tirsa Valley\|Tirsa Valley]] in [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]]. Evolving in a valley protected from the harsh coastal winds, this variant has developed a significantly denser physical structure.
# Etymology
From *Tirsian* and English *wood* + *pod*.
# Morphology
The shrub grows to a similar height as the [[Root Resources/Flora/Thamnophytes/Schellese Woodpod\|Schellese woodpod]] but features darker, reddish-brown bark and leaves with a subtle maroon tint. The pods are a deep, matte red rather than brown, with a shell consistency akin to hard-cured wood or stone. The seeds inside are paler and denser than the common variety.
# Physiology
The seeds possess a duller, earthier taste compared to the Schellese variety.
## Mechanisms
The hardness of the pod protects the seeds from smaller pests, requiring larger local fauna or tool-using humans to crack them open.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The Tirsian woodpod fruits later than its cousin, with pods ripening in late autumn.
# Ecology
It relies on the humid, stable microclimate of the [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Tirsa Valley/Tirsa Valley\|Tirsa Valley]].

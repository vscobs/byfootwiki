The kolla is a small, woody shrub prized for the sticky resin exuded from its stems.
# Etymology
From Ancient Greek *κόλλα* (*kólla*, “glue”).
# Morphology
Kolla grow up to 35 centimeters tall with broad, dark grayish-green leaves and thick stems. Tiny, cream-colored flowers appear in tight clusters that extrude in height from the main body of the shrub.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
The plant is exceptionally good at wind-pollination, taking into account its raised flower clusters.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It germinates in early spring, in the beginning of March, and flowers by early summer.
# Ecology
In addition to its sexual reproduction, kolla also reproduce asexually, through stolons. It favors windy regions.

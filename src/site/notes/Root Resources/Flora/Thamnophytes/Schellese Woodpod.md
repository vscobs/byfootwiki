The Schellese woodpod is a hardy, fruit-bearing shrub widespread across the western icosachores of [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. Known for its reliability, the shrub produces abundant fruit from May until late October. Its peak consumption occurs in October, when the pods are typically boiled or roasted with [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|carite]] salt.
# Etymology
From English demonym Schellese and *wood* + *pod*.
# Morphology
The shrub is low and wide, rarely taller than 1.2 meters but often spreading 2 to 4 meters across. Leaves are upright, grass-like, and rigid. Flowers are discreet, dark yellow or gray. Fruits grow in paired pods with a woody, break-resistant exterior. Once opened, each pod reveals the edible “fruit” — technically seeds — in shades of brown to dark yellow.
# Physiology
Adapted to nutrient-poor soils and low hydration.
## Mechanisms
Spreads clonally by root extension to form resilient thickets.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The shrub flowers and fruits on a four-month cycle, with blossoms appearing in midsummer and pods maturing by late autumn.
# Ecology
Pollination is carried out by [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Families/Featherfly (Ptilopteridae)\|featherflies]] (especially [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Crawling Featherfly\|crawling]] and [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Xylofeatherfly\|wood featherflies]]) and dwarf finbirds. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil against erosion in coastal and interior environments.

The honeysap is a flowering shrub known for producing sticky, sweet sap from its woody stems, often used in sweeteners and medical infusions.
# Etymology
From English *honey* + *sap*.
# Morphology
The honeysap grows up to 90 centimeters tall. Its wood is slender and reddish-brown, and its tiny orange-yellow flowers are usually 4 to 5 centimeters wide.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
The sap seeps from natural fractures in its stems. Sap production peaks during the flowering phase.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The honeysap germinates in early spring and flowers by mid-summer. The honeysap dies in late fall after its seeds set.
# Ecology
For reproduction, the plant relies on insect and wind pollination.

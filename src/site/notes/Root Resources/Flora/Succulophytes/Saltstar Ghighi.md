The saltstar ghighi is a robust succulent belonging to a distinct genus within the broader ghighi family. It is a low-growing halophyte to the western coast of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]].
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The plant is defined by its strict geometric structure: it grows in a 5-point rosette formation, with thick, triangular leaves. The base is deep green, transitioning to a mute rosy-purplish hue toward the tips. The epidermis is thick and waxy.
# Physiology
Highly salt-tolerant.
## Mechanisms
The waxy epidermis repels excess ocean spray. Specialized pores excrete crystallized salt.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It blooms in late summer, sending up a short, sturdy stalk capped with star-shaped flowers.
# Ecology
It acts as a soil stabilizer on erosion-prone cliffs. The moisture-rich heart of the rosette is occasionally scavenged by [[Root Resources/Fauna/Pinnavians/Helix Finbird\|helix finbirds]] during drought.

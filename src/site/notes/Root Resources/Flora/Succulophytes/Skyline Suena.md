A clonal, succulent-like plant that dominates pockets of deeper soil. Skyline suena is an aggressive competitor: many stems share a single, extensive root system that lets the plant monopolize scarce substrate and water.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Columnar stems in groups of four or more emerging from one broad, buried rootstock. Outer rind is hard and leathery; the interior is unusually watery and translucent. Flowers small and inconspicuous.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
Spreads clonally by the shared root system. Heavy local root competition allows skyline suena to “drain” neighboring plants.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Growth is seasonal – rapid expansion in wet seasons, dormancy in drought/heat. Individual stems senesce while the shared root produces new stems.
## Social Structure
Where it forms thickets, it strongly alters local plant communities.
# Ecology
Human disturbance (digging, root fragmentation) increases local spread.

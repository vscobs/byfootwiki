The blue ghighi is a rare variant of the ghighi, restricted to the island of [[Geography/Zones/Savail Island\|Savail Island]] in the [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Schell/Schell\|Schell]] archipelago. It is immediately recognizable by its pale blue or lavender petals and fruit tones.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The blue ghighi reaches heights of 3.5 m. Leaves are small and arrow-shaped, arranged in three vertical rows along the stems. Flowers bloom in pale blue to lavender, their petals thick and triangular. Fruits are more fibrous and less succulent than the common ghighi, with a denser texture and muted taste.
# Physiology
Leaves store hydrating gel while young and dry as they age.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Flowering begins in May and fruits ripen by late august. Reproduction occurs through reliable self-pollination.
# Ecology
It occurs in small, scattered populations. Its fruits are less frequently consumed by local fauna due to their fibrous quality, but the petals are more commonly targeted by herbivores.

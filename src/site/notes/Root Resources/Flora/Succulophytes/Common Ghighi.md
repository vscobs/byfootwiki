The common ghighi is a tall, rare succulent plant native to both the [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan and Schell archipelagos]]. Although not widespread, it is a recognizable and culturally significant plant.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The common ghighi grows almost straight upward, reaching up to 3.5 m. Leaves are arranged along three vertical lines, forming small arrow shapes. Flowers develop at the stem tops, composed of six thick, triangular petals in shades of purple, pink, or orange. Fruit appears once annually as elongated bulbs containing soft, sweet pulp.
# Physiology
Leaves store characteristic gel.
## Mechanisms
Reproduces mainly through self-pollination: six long white-tipped stamens naturally bend inward to touch the female organ. Petals retain water and continue nourishing the developing fruit until it detaches.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The plant begins flowering in May, with fruit maturing by late august.
# Ecology
It thrives in sandy soils enriched by the presence of [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helices]]. The presence of ghighi colonies indicates stable sandy soils with high mineral content.

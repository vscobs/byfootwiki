Unknown.
# Morphology
Smaller, squat stems with an orange-patterned epidermis – brick-orange, green mottling and fine textural ridges. Pulp is drier and firmer than skyline suena; rind thinner and easier to peel.
# Physiology
Not specified.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Flowers and fruiting follow the rainy season.
## Social Structure

# Ecology
Coexists with other plants more readily than its aggressive cousin. Humans cultivate sanguine varieties for pigment extraction and ornamentals.

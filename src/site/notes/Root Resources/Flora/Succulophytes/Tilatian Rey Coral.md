The Tilatian rey coral is a long-lived succulent of the northern coasts and islands, prized as much for its striking form as for its fruit. Its presence is unmistakable: thick, coral-like growths rising from rocky ground.
# Etymology
From English.
# Morphology
The plant is structured around massive, branching stems, each 20–30 cm thick that resemble terrestrial coral formations. Along their length emerge round inflorescences composed of densely layered petals, giving the flowers a spherical, metallic-red appearance. Fruits are large, firm-skinned, and juicy.
# Physiology
Stems are fleshy, storing water and nutrients.
## Mechanisms
The thick stems slowly exude a clear, sticky secretion that regulates surface moisture and traps airborne salts.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Under ideal conditions, individual plants can live for up to fifteen years. The plant flowers once annually in mid-August.
# Ecology
Adapted to wind-heavy, moisture-variable coastal environments. Fruits aid seed dispersal through animal transport.

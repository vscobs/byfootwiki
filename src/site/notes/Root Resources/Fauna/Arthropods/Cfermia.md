The cfermia is a large arthropod found throughout [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]], particularly near [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Mafera\|mafera]] trees and [[Root Resources/Fungi/Giant Hupsaja\|giant hupsaja]]. Reaching two to four centimeters in length, it thrives in rocky, [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]-rich soils and shallow caves.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Cfermia are slender and armored. The black exoskeleton possesses a metallic sheen that produces blue structural coloration. They possess six legs and prominent mandibles but lack antennae and tails. Wings are present but reserved for moments of extreme threat; they may be torn off during combat. The physical build is adapted for navigating rocky crevices, underground chambers, and root systems.
# Physiology
The species produces a potent poisonous secretion.
## Diet
The species is herbivorous, favoring [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Mafera\|maferfruit]].
## Mechanisms
The poisonous secretion is capable of dissolving hard seeds, pods, and roots.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The species undergoes three to four molting stages without metamorphosis and lives up to eight months. Females lay 60 to 70 eggs over four to five days before abandoning the nest.
## Social Structure
Males live and forage cooperatively within colonies, whereas females are solitary, aggressive, and significantly larger. Males and juveniles sustain the colony after the female departs.
# Ecology
Cfermia maintain a symbiotic relationship with [[Root Resources/Fungi/Giant Hupsaja\|giant hupsaja]], defending the fungus from predators in exchange for moisture. They construct complex nests by consuming [[Root Resources/Fungi/Giant Hupsaja\|giant hupsaja]], [[Root Resources/Flora/Bryophytes/Pebblepip\|pebblepip]], and petals, then regurgitating the material to solidify into protective structures. Nests are located in rock fissures, underground chambers, and soil.

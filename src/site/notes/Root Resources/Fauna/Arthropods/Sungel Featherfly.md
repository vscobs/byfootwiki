The sungel featherfly is a large species common in northeastern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. It is the only known frugivore-carnivore [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Families/Featherfly (Ptilopteridae)\|featherfly]] species.
# Etymology
From English sun + gel.
# Morphology
Adults reach 5-6 cm in body length and 1 cm in width. The body is white with four pale yellow abdominal bands and a darker yellow terminal segment. Wings are highly feathery with elongated, plume-like scales. Legs are black with featherlike tips for handling pollen. Antennae are short. No sexual dimorphism is recorded.
# Physiology
It produces "sungel," a clear yellowish jelly formed when pollen and nectar (from [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Suntower\|suntowers]], [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Soonumba\|soonumbas]], and [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Roscourd (plant)\|roscourds]]) are stored in sun-exposed nests.
## Diet
It consumes "sungel" and attracts smaller insects and mammals, which it subdues and consumes.
## Mechanisms
The venom is extremely fast-acting, lethal to small prey within seconds.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It is long-lived, with adult lifespans of approximately six months. Eggs are deposited within the sungel matrix.
## Social Structure
The species is crepuscular to diurnal. Activity is year-round, though gel production halts in cold months. Nests are built in sun-exposed areas without enclosed chambers, relying on chemical defense.
# Ecology
The jelly attracts smaller insects and mammals.

The couredew featherfly is a subspecies restricted to [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Roscourd\|Roscourd]] in western [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. It is a key pollinator of the [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Roscourd (plant)\|roscourd flower]] and serves as prey for small mammals and predatory insects.
# Etymology
From Latin cor ("heart") and English dew.
# Morphology
Adults measure 2-3 cm in body length with a 2 cm wingspan. The body is thick and covered in fine microhairs. Coloration is dark gray with faint, dark magenta irregular spots on the abdomen. Females are larger than males by approximately 5 mm and display more pronounced markings. The species uses four legs for sensory function and locomotion; antennae are reduced. Forewings are 8 cm long, 4.5 cm wide and translucent. Hindwings are narrow microwings adapted for maneuverability.
# Physiology
Antennae are reduced. Four legs are used for sensory function.
## Diet
Adults feed primarily on roscourd nectar.
# Behavior
The subspecies is diurnal and seasonal, with activity synchronized to the bloom of [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Roscourd (plant)\|roscourd flowers]] (mid-spring to early autumn).
## Life Cycle
The lifespan is 3 to 4 months. Eggs are laid on vegetation and enter dormancy during colder months. Mating occurs in April with high-pitched chirping calls.

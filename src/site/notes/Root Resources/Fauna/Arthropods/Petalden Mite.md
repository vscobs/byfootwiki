The petalden mite is a tiny insect, biologically distinct from arachnids despite its common name. It functions as a decomposer of organic matter, specifically flowers and grasses, and is known for repurposing petals as nests.
# Etymology
From English petal + den and mite.
# Morphology
The mite measures 2 to 3 millimeters in length. It possesses a dark, matte exoskeleton for camouflage in shaded floral environments. The body is fuzzy, with flat legs adapted for gripping wilting plant surfaces. Short antennae detect chemical cues from decaying flora to locate nesting and feeding sites.
# Physiology
Short antennae detect chemical cues.
## Diet
The mite feeds on pollen and decaying plant matter.
## Mechanisms
Nests are constructed by binding freshly fallen petals with silk near flower heads.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The total lifespan, from egg to adult, ranges from 9 to 13 days.
## Social Structure
Not specified.
# Ecology
The resulting nest structure resembles a healthy flower, protecting the inhabitant from predators. The mite accelerates nutrient recycling.

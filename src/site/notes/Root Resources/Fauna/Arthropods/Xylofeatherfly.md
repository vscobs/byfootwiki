The xylofeatherfly, or wood featherfly, is a solitary, arboreal subspecies found across [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. It inhabits nests near tree trunks, roots, or within cavities excavated using wood-dissolving secretions.
# Etymology
From Greek ξύλο (xýlo, "wood") + English featherfly.
# Morphology
Adults are approximately 1 cm long with a flattened, tear-shaped body and large abdomen. Coloration is light brown with faint circular abdominal stripes for camouflage against bark. Wings are vestigial and autotomic. Limbs are thin and covered with micro hairs for crawling. Males and females are similar in appearance.
# Physiology
Adults are generally slow-moving but capable of rapid movement when threatened.
## Diet
The species is strictly herbivorous, feeding on softened tree bark (excluding the toxic [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Mafera\|mafera tree]]).
## Mechanisms
It excavates cavities using wood-dissolving secretions.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The lifespan is several months to one year. Females reproduce annually, depositing a large clutch over one month before abandoning the nest. No parental care is provided.
## Social Structure
Males build and maintain nests to house mated females during egg-laying.
# Ecology
The species modifies its habitat by hollowing soft wood for shelter without killing the host tree.

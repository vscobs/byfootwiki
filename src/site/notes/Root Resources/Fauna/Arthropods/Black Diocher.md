The black diocher is a small, shelled terrestrial animal endemic to the [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan-Schell]] archipelago. It is a strict land-dweller with a glossy black exoskeleton and a heavy, flattened spherical shell. The species lodges atop [[Root Resources/Flora/Aerophytes/Helix Sini\|helix sini]] catkin crowns to feed on nectar. This feeding activity stimulates the plant to produce more nectar, establishing a mutualistic association where the diocher serves as an accidental pollinator.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The shell is a biologically secreted variant of [[Root Resources/Minerals/Schellesite\|schellesite]], layered and deposited throughout growth. It measures 2-6 cm in diameter and approximately 3 cm in height. Females typically possess light-brown shells with brownish markings, while males display vivid orange markings. The flattened-spherical shell bears two lateral "horns" that develop continuously with age. The body features a hard exoskeleton and modified tarsal claws used to anchor the animal on catkin tips, bark, or soil. Upon death, the soft body decomposes rapidly, leaving the shell, composed of [[Root Resources/Minerals/Schellesite\|schellesite]], intact.
# Physiology
The species possesses a hard exoskeleton and modified tarsal claws specialized for anchoring itself. Diocher's shells grow in accordance to the animal.
## Diet
The species feeds on the nectar of [[Root Resources/Flora/Aerophytes/Helix Sini\|Helix Sini]] catkins.
## Mechanisms
When threatened, the animal retracts fully into the shell, utilizing horns and spines for defense.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Eggs are deposited exposed on or near the catkin structure and hatch in approximately 6 days. Hatchlings are direct-developing, translucent miniatures of adults. They develop a proto-shell over three weeks and reach full adult form at six weeks. The average lifespan is five to six months. Females remain with a selected mate until egg-laying concludes. Black diocher do not build nests.
# Ecology
Healthy Helix Sini catkins with attached diochers persist and flower more vigorously due to the passive pollen transfer and nectar stimulation. Shells are collected post-mortem and serve as a primary source of schellesite on [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan-Schell]]. Locals process the shells into cutting implements, decorative inlays, and tool edges. Sustainable harvesting focuses on collected shells rather than live specimens.

The crawling featherfly is a solitary, flightless species widespread across [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. It inhabits tree branches and leaf litter in forests, gardens, and wooded regions. Adults are diurnal, with activity concentrated during daylight hours.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Adults measure approximately 3 cm in length. Coloration is a uniform dark brown to black with no distinct markings. The wings are vestigial, non-functional, and autotomic (capable of being shed) as a defensive adaptation. The body is compact and flattened to facilitate movement across foliage. Sexual dimorphism is minimal, with females appearing slightly broader.
# Physiology
The species is capable of rapid bursts of speed when provoked despite being generally slow-moving to conserve energy.
## Diet
The species is herbivorous, consuming leaves from non-toxic plants.
## Mechanisms
Wings are autotomic and can be shed for defense.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The lifespan ranges from eight to twelve months. Females reproduce infrequently, laying eggs over a period of roughly three months while remaining immobile in protected areas.
## Social Structure
They remain hidden in secluded spaces or nests during rest periods and associate with conspecifics only for mating.
# Ecology
The crawling featherfly exhibits energy-conserving behaviors but demonstrates agility during defense or resource competition.

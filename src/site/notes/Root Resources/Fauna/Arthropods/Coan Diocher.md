The **Coan diocher**, or white diocher, is a rare shelled land animal endemic to the [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan/Coan\|Coan Archipelago]]. It occupies a similar ecological niche to the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Black Diocher\|black diocher]], feeding on [[Root Resources/Flora/Aerophytes/Helix Sini\|helix sini]] catkins.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The Coan diocher measures 2-6 cm in diameter and approximately 3 cm in height. It is distinguished by a fully white, immaculate shell lacking external markings. Faint pink undertones are visible on the shell interior due to the schellesite mineral base. The shell bears two lateral horns which are relatively short and dull. The exoskeleton is glossy black in both sexes. Females display warmer undertones on the shell interior, while males are typically brighter white externally.
# Physiology
The species possesses a high bite force.
## Diet
They prefer catkin nectar, but individuals occasionally forage opportunistically on other flowers.
## Mechanisms
The high bite force is utilized for feeding and as a deterrent against fauna attempting to displace it from feeding sites.
# Behavior
Reduced reliance on horn defense is compensated by a powerful bite used to maintain territory.
## Life Cycle
The species breeds twice yearly, laying eggs exposed atop helix sini catkins. Clutch sizes are small, often fewer than 10 eggs. Development is direct: juveniles hatch as translucent miniatures, gain a proto-shell in three weeks, and reach adulthood after six weeks. Adults live up to 11 months.
# Ecology
The Coan diocher exerts pressure on nectar resources but remains less populous than the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Black Diocher\|black diocher]]. The white diocher is a cultural symbol of rarity and resilience on the [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan/Coan\|Coan]] islands. Historically, traders acquired Coan Diocher shells for fashioning into decorative objects and ceremonial tools.

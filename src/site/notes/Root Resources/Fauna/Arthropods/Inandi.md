Inandi are translucent cave-dwelling insects found throughout [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]]'s subterranean networks. They are highly toxic to most predators but harmless to the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Kermarou\|kermarou]], with which they co-evolved.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Adults measure 2-8 cm and are largely translucent, featuring subtle bioluminescent patches for mating displays. Hatchlings possess fully formed wings and are flight-capable, whereas adults are grounded due to increased mass. Wing colors are muted. The body is elongated, soft, and adapted for climbing cave surfaces.
# Physiology
They utilize bioluminescence for mating displays.
## Diet
Not specified.
## Mechanisms
They are highly toxic to most predators. Toxicity increases with the depth of the habitat.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The lifespan is approximately four months. Hatchlings emerge winged and mobile; adults lose flight capability. Reproduction occurs once per season.
## Social Structure
Populations peak seasonally, contributing significant biomass to the cave food web.
# Ecology
Inandi provide seasonal nutrient pulses and shape predator-prey dynamics within cave ecosystems.

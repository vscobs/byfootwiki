The pugenair is a small, fist-sized flying creature common to the forests of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Berra/Berra\|Berra]] and the sheltering slopes of the [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Tirsa Valley/Tirsa Valley\|Tirsa Valley]]. It is an agile flyer, darting through dense undergrowth to catch insects on the wing, and is easily identified by its piercing call.
# Etymology
From Latin *pugnus* ("fist", referring to its size) + English *air*.
# Morphology
The pugenair is covered in tiny, incredibly dense feathers that give it a sleek, almost fur-like appearance. Its plumage is a uniform dark brown, providing excellent camouflage against tree bark, contrasted only by a sharp, jet-black beak enveloped in a circular white stripe. Despite its small size, it possesses a loud voice: its distinct, high-pitched birdsong is a rhythmic whistle that echoes through the land it inhabits.
# Physiology
Possesses a sharp beak and dense plumage suitable for camouflage.
## Diet
Pugenairs are insectivorous, feeding on small flying bugs and larvae.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
They nest in the hollows of trees.
## Social Structure
They are highly territorial during the mating season in late spring.
# Ecology
They act as insectivores within the dense undergrowth of forests and valleys.

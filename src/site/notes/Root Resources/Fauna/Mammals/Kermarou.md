Kermarou are small, long-legged mammals that inhabit the rocky hills and sandstone crevices of [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]], in [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. They are key omnivorous species, serving as prey for mid-level predators while dispersing seeds and controlling insect populations. Kermarou have high reproductive output, allowing populations to remain stable despite predation and harsh conditions.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Kermarou are slender with long legs, agile bodies, and light-colored eyes adapted for low-light environments. Fur varies among species but is generally short and pale.
# Physiology
They have fast-running gaits.
## Diet
They are omnivorous, feeding on insects like Inandi, mosses, and small plants such as Pebblepip.
## Mechanisms
Their vocalizations include high-pitched chirps for alarm or territorial signaling.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Kermarou breed once per year at the end of winter, spring, and summer, producing litters of three to four offspring. Juveniles mature quickly.
## Social Structure
Solitary and territorial.
# Ecology
Nests are built in small caves, crevices, or under boulders. Juveniles disperse to establish their own territories, contributing to the species’ resilience in the rocky plains.

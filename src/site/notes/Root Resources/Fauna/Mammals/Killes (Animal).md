The Killes is a massive semi-aquatic apex predator that inhabits the coastal waters of southern [[Geography/Icosachores/COLMETRY/Colmetry\|Colmetry]] and [[Geography/Icosachores/NUSARA/Nusara\|Nusara]], in the southern part of the [[Geography/Oceans and Seas/Anaric Ocean\|Anaric Ocean]].
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
The animal is formidable in size, measuring approximately 6 meters from snout to rear. Though able to inhabit both land and sea, its physiology favors the aquatic environment. It features four short, stocky legs that are capable of terrestrial locomotion but are primarily designed to tuck flush against the torso to reduce drag while swimming.

The pelage consists of thin, short beige-grey fur covering the dorsal side, while the underside, limbs, and mouth area are darker and nearly hairless. The head features a distinct muzzle extending around 11 to 13 centimeters from the face. The eyes are relatively small compared to its skull size, with irises of a nearly pitch-black hue.
# Physiology
The killes possesses visual adaptations suited for murky or deep waters; its pupils are wide, allowing for maximum light intake. Its jaw structure supports large, serrated teeth specifically evolved to shear through flesh rather than crush bone.
## Diet
It is a carnivore and an opportunistic hunter. It will prey upon any creature smaller than itself, making it the dominant threat in its ecosystem.
## Mechanisms
The killes locks its limbs against its body to become a living torpedo. Despite its bulk, it retains startling agility and speed in the water. On land, it remains dangerous due to its sheer mass and aggression.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
The killes is a mammal that reproduces sexually. Mating is seasonal and strictly terrestrial; during this period, individuals migrate to specific beaches to copulate. Gestation concludes on land as well, with females giving birth to a small litter of one to two pups.
## Social Structure
Outside of the breeding season, individuals are highly aggressive and territorial, often clashing over hunting grounds. However, during mating season, they form volatile, temporary aggregations on coastal beaches.
# Ecology
Primarily roaming the open waters, the killes enters the littoral zone frequently enough to pose a threat to local coastal communities. It does not fear sapient settlements and will attack humans or livestock that venture too close to the water's edge.
# In Heraldry
The killes is present in the coat of arms of [[Geography/Icosachores/COLMETRY/Killesteeth/Killesteeth\|Killesteeth]].

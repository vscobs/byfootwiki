The Midivian cansbiah is the type species of the cansbiah.
# Etymology
Possibly from Proto-Germanic habīgaz (“heavy, weighty”), from Proto-Indo-European keh₂p- (“to grasp, have, hold”). Compare Latin capāx (“capacious, spacious”).
# Morphology
The cansbiah is a quadruped, standing on four dense paws. Its body is stocky and robust, reaching up to 180 centimeters at the shoulder, with thick muscles built for both stamina and speed. Its fur is dense, dark, and uniquely wavy, usually black or deep brown. It has a coarse, long-haired tail that hangs low behind its body. Its eyes are usually brown or dark yellow.
# Physiology
Muscles are built for both stamina and speed.
## Diet
They are omnivores, grazing on shrubs, roots, and fruit, while also hunting or scavenging carrion.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
They have a high reproductive rate and can live up to 30 years in the wild, with multiple generations coexisting in a single pack.
## Social Structure
Cansbiah are highly social, living in tight-knit family groups led by a dominant breeding pair and their offspring. While most groups number between 8 and 12 members, some rare packs exceeding 30 members have been observed. Known for their cooperative behaviors, they share food, defend territory collectively, and care for the young communally.

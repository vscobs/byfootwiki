Atimises are tiny, semi-aquatic mammals endemic to the [[Geography/Icosachores/NUSARA/Nusara\|Nusaran]] sandstone caves and their adjacent coastal waters.
# Etymology
From Greek ακτή (aktí, “shore”) + μῦς (mûs, “mouse”).
# Morphology
Atimises possess dense, soft silvery-white fur that appears subtly reflective. Their coats are marked with faint brown or off-white stripes that vary slightly between individuals. Males exhibit more pronounced or deeper-colored striping, a mild expression of sexual dimorphism. Seasonal shifts affect both sexes: during summer, the stripes become darker, while in cooler seasons the coat lightens and the markings soften. Each animal has four agile limbs and a flattened, paddle-like hairy tail adapted for propulsion in water. Their hairless paws bear curved claws, enabling efficient digging in sand, scaling wet rock surfaces, and swimming. Eye coloration ranges from pitch black to pale blue or green, with other hues being rare.
# Physiology
Atimises exhibit prolonged apnea underwater.
## Diet
Atimises forage for [[Root Resources/Flora/Thalassophytes/Umin\|umin]] fruits and small marine invertebrates.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
They breed annually, producing litters of three to four offspring.
## Social Structure
They emit brief, high-pitched squeaks as a form of communication and sleep communally (either within root tangles or in shallow sand burrows).
# Ecology
During daylight hours, they forage, stashing collected items within the interlaced [[Root Resources/Flora/Thalassophytes/Umin\|umin]] roots. They are frequently seen circling near [[Root Resources/Flora/Thalassophytes/Umin\|umin]] shrubs for extended periods. They retreat into root mats or shallow caves to rest and defend against nocturnal predators such as the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Sandstone Cansbiah\|sandstone cansbiah]] through rapid, darting movements.

The altoratile is a small, coastal mammal of the northern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaian]] shorelines, most commonly encountered along the wind-softened cliffs of northern [[Geography/Icosachores/WINDSWING/Windswing\|Windswing]] and beaches of northern [[Geography/Icosachores/MIFLEUS/Mifleus\|Mifleus]]. Unhurried, observant, and notably unafraid of nearby human activity, the altoratile is commonly seen resting among rock piles, abandoned breakwaters, or the lee sides of coastal buildings.
# Etymology
From Latin altus (“high, tall”) + ora (“coast”) + -atilis (“belonging to, dwelling in").
# Morphology
Altoratiles possess a dense but thin-haired coat ranging from pale orange to light brown, often paling further along the underbelly and throat. Its tail is often 65-75 cm long and with a considerably decreased hair density, serving primarily as a counterbalance during careful descents. The ears are broad and mobile. Claws are adapted for scrambling and holding prey.
# Physiology
The ears have soft margins that dampen wind noise while enhancing directional hearing.
## Diet
It feeds primarily on small birds, nestlings, and coastal mammals.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Breeding occurs opportunistically rather than seasonally, with offspring raised in sheltered rock hollows or structural cavities near the shore.
## Social Structure
Their docility toward humans appears not to be domestication but a byproduct of reduced territorial aggression and low competition for prey. Altoratile individuals tolerate overlapping ranges and may be observed resting within sight of one another. Individuals often reuse the same lookout and resting sites for years.
# Ecology
The species occupies low to mid coastal rock zones, favoring areas where stone, sand, and human-made structures intersect. It relies on patience and positional advantage rather than rapid pursuit.

The tailed rupatile is an agile carnivorous and insectivorous mammal native to the steep cliffs and rocky escarpments of [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]] in [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]]. It occupies a niche as a mid-to-apex predator in harsh, exposed habitats.
# Etymology
From English tailed and Latin rupes (“cliff, rock”) + -atilis (“belonging to, dwelling in").
# Morphology
The tailed rupatile has a nearly hairless, compact body with short silvery-brown and orange fur patches. Its eyes are black and highly sensitive to low light. A long, muscular tail enhances stability during vertical climbs. Limbs are strong and agile, ending in curved claws suited for gripping rock surfaces.
# Physiology
Its keen hearing allows it to detect prey in crevices and ledges.
## Diet
It preys on smaller mammals (such as the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Kermarou\|kermarou]]) and insects (such as [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Cfermia\|cfermia]]).
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Breeding occurs once per year, with small litters raised in hidden nests. Young develop climbing and hunting skills gradually under parental supervision before dispersing.
## Social Structure
Solitary by nature, tailed rupatiles maintain territories along cliff faces.
# Ecology
They hunt actively, using stealth and rapid movement to capture prey.

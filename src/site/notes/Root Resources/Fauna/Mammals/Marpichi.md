The marpichi is a small, semi-aquatic mammal endemic to the grassy dunes and plains of the [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Schell/Schell\|Schell Archipelago]].
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Marpichi are compact species. Females stand 40–50 cm tall and measure 60–80 cm long, while males are slightly larger at 55–70 cm in height and 60–90 cm in length. Their bodies are pinkish-white with subtle pale gray or brown stripes, and their snouts and tails are dark brown. This coloration provides light camouflage against sandy dunes and inside spiralcones, blending them into the pastel and mottled fungal structures where they often nest.
# Physiology
Marpichi are versatile swimmers.
## Diet
They feed on fibrous dune grasses, invertebrates, and occasionally the nutrient-rich spore-pods of spiralcones.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Reproduction is seasonal: courtship occurs in early spring, with litters of 2–4 cubs born during summer. Young reach maturity at 2–3 years, and adults live 16–18 years.
## Social Structure
Living in loosely organized groups of 4 to 15 individuals, they combine playful swimming, shallow hunting, and burrowing behavior. Their cooperative lifestyle allows them to defend shared nests and forage efficiently.
# Ecology
Marpichi thrive in the shallow tidal pools and dune hollows surrounding [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|Schell helices]]. As omnivores and dune engineers, they help maintain nutrient flow in their habitat. Their burrowing aerates the sand, while leftover spore-pods and fecal matter fertilize the soil. By dispersing spiralcone spores, they contribute to the growth of fungal colonies that, in turn, provide shelter and food for other animals.

The scuti is a large grazing species found in the open plains and rocky coastal regions of southern [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/East Nua\|East Nua]], in the districts of [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/Falx\|Falx]], [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/Menumar Isles\|Menumar Isles]] (rarer) and [[Geography/Icosachores/EAST NUA/Nuan Plains\|Nuan Plains]]. It’s known for its shimmering black markings.
# Etymology
Genitive singular of Latin scutum (“shield”), literally “of a shield”.
# Morphology
The scuti stands at around 1,2 meters at the shoulder and reaches 1,8 meters in length. It has a stocky build and short limbs. Its dense, coarse fur varies slightly in color, ranging from golden brown to a muted tan. Distinct shimmering patches on its shoulders, back, legs and face exhibit structural coloration, reflecting deep blues and violets under certain angles. Its eyes display a high phenotypic variation, with colors ranging from red, golden and yellow to blue, green and violet (although rarer). Heterochromia is also common.
# Physiology
The shimmering patches utilize structural coloration.
## Diet
Grazing species.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
(Not specified).
## Social Structure
It follows a herd structure, typically moving in groups of 5 to 12 individuals, though older males are solitary.
# Ecology
Scuti are crepuscular beings, meaning they’re most active during dawn and dusk, when its iridescent patches interact optimally with the shifting light.

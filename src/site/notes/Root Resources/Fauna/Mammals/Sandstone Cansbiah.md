The sandstone cansbiah lives in the sandstone caves of northeastern [[Geography/Icosachores/NUSARA/Nusara\|Nusara]].
# Etymology
Possibly from Proto-Germanic habīgaz (“heavy, weighty”), from Proto-Indo-European keh₂p- (“to grasp, have, hold”). Compare Latin capāx (“capacious, spacious”).
# Morphology
The sandstone cansbiah is smaller than the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Midivian Cansbiah\|Midivian cansbiah]] and has orange fur instead of the common dark brown or black. This change in coloration may serve as camouflage, blending the animal with the tones of its sandstone environment.
# Physiology
Adapted for nocturnal hunting.
## Diet
The sandstone cansbiah feeds primarily on [[Root Resources/Flora/Thalassophytes/Umin\|umin fruit]] and ocasionally on [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Atimis\|atimises]].

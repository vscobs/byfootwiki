A rare, nocturnal monotreme mammal measuring 4 to 6 centimeters in length, this species is a specialized ectoparasite of large flying animals. Due to its inefficient energy use and strict parasitic lifestyle, it is considered vulnerable and possibly nearing extinction.
# Etymology
From English bird + bat.
# Morphology
This species is covered in short, soft fur ranging from dark gray to dark brownish-gray. Its wings also bear a sparse layer of very soft fur and are composed of thin, opaque skin. The wings are supported by four digits, each tipped with short, thin claws designed to minimize disturbance to the host. Its thin teeth are specialized in painless blood-sucking. A thin but wide tail, made of the same membrane material as the wings, assists in flight. The eyes are solid black, adapted for its nocturnal lifestyle.
# Physiology
It suffers from inefficient energy use.
## Diet
It feeds exclusively on host blood through brief but substantial feeding sessions.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Feeding sessions occur every 4 to 6 days.
## Social Structure
This solitary creature locates hosts under cover of darkness.
# Ecology
It attaches itself with claws and teeth to feed, then detaches and remains inactive until its next meal.

The ghost pamperva is a slow-moving, herbivorous marine animal found throughout eastern [[Geography/Esgaia\|Esgaia]] and the southern coast of [[Geography/Icosachores/SOUTHWEST NUA/Southwest Nua\|Southwest Nua]].
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Ghost pamperva are 5–9 cm long and 2–3 cm wide, with soft, thin skin and a flattened, semi-transparent body. Their four thin, fin-like membranes extend from the body and undulate in a looping motion to navigate the water. The head is flattened and integrated into the body. They are ghostly white, with no markings, and males and females are indistinguishable.
# Physiology
## Diet
Feeds continuously on microalgae and tiny marine plants, occasionally supplementing with smaller pamperva.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Individuals live for about 10 months. They reproduce via egg-laying, producing roughly 80 eggs per clutch on rock crevices or sea-forest substrates. Eggs develop without parental care, and hatchlings mature in 2–3 weeks. Females continue laying eggs until death.
## Social Structure
Mostly passive and rarely threatened; occasionally forms small groups.
# Ecology
Helps to maintain clean shallow waters. Small populations are preyed on by opportunistic [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Marpichi\|marpichi]] onshore.

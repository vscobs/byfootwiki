The helix finbird is a large, solitary pinnavian apex predator distributed across [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan-Schell]], as well as the coastal cliffs of [[Geography/Icosachores/VILEUS/Vileus\|Vileus]] and [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Roscourd-Yalia\|Roscourd-Yalia]]. Comparable in size to the largest pinnavians, its body measures roughly a meter and a half in length with wingspans reaching 5–6 meters.
# Etymology
From English *fin* + *bird*.
# Morphology
This finbird is distinguished by a thin, lightweight body adapted for rapid descents and maneuverability. The fur is reflective white with muted orange markings along the wings. Its translucent pseudofins contour the wings and flanks, shorter and sharper than those of related species, designed to flex with the wind during high-speed dives. Large eyes provide excellent vision for spotting prey from great heights, while the jaw bears pronounced canines adapted for piercing. Its claws are wide, black, and equipped with long talons.
# Physiology
The fur is resistant to the heat of direct sunlight. The reduced body mass allows it to remain agile and efficient in the air.
## Diet
Helix finbirds are primarily scavengers, feeding almost exclusively on [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Marpichi\|marpichi]] carcasses, though they will actively hunt live [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Marpichi\|marpichi]] when food is scarce.
## Mechanisms
Pseudofins flex with the wind to aid high-speed dives.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Reproduction occurs opportunistically, most often in early spring or autumn. Females lay 2–4 eggs per litter, leaving them in the male’s nest before departing; males alone raise the young. Cubs remain immobile for up to four months and require extended parental care. Adults can live between 18–20 years.
## Social Structure
Individuals patrol fixed coastal ranges, usually returning to the same nest year after year unless it is destroyed.
# Ecology
As the apex predator of [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan-Schell]], the helix finbird plays a vital role in regulating [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Marpichi\|marpichi]] populations. The species is closely tied to [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|schell helices]], where it builds nests at the highest points. Outside of [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan-Schell\|Coan-Schell]], it prefers sheer coastal cliffs.

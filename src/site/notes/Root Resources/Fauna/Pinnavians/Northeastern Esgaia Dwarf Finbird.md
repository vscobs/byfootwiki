The northeastern Esgaia dwarf finbird is a small pinnavian species within the finbird family. Adults average 18 cm in length and 5–6 cm in width, making them one of the smallest finbirds known. They are strongly tied to habitats where [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Suntower\|suntowers]] dominate.
# Etymology
From English *fin* + *bird*, with the “dwarf” distinction referring to the genus of smaller-bodied finbirds.
# Morphology
This species has a lightweight build compared to the stockier [[Root Resources/Fauna/Pinnavians/Mafer Finbird\|mafer finbird]]. The body is covered in short, fine fur of a dry bluish hue, with females slightly larger and bearing darker coloration than males. Wings are furred but translucent, supported by transparent cartilaginous structures. The tail ends in a reduced fin-like extension. Their claws are dull and fur-covered, suited for perching rather than tearing.
# Physiology
Large, dark eyes aid precision flight, and the compact body contributes to their agility.
## Diet
They are primarily frugivorous, feeding on [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Soonumba\|soonumba]] berries, but may turn insectivorous and prey on [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Sungel Featherfly\|sungel featherflies]] when fruit is scarce.
## Specific Abilities
Capable of precise flight control to avoid collisions during coordinated play.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Reproduction occurs once per year, with females giving birth to 3–8 cubs after a 5-month gestation, typically in early winter. Cubs are semi-altricial, requiring parental care for 3–4 weeks before gaining independence. Lifespan averages 8 years.
## Social Structure
These dwarf finbirds live in small familial groups and are highly social, often engaging in coordinated flight play. Nests are rebuilt yearly, though older ones may be dismantled and repurposed.
# Ecology
As the principal disperser of [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Soonumba\|soonumba]], they are a keystone species in northeastern Esgaia’s forest and plain ecosystems. They construct nests high in [[Root Resources/Flora/Dendrophytes/Suntower\|suntowers]] from sepals, dried roots, and branches.

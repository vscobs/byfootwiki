The Coan helix finbird is a subspecies of the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Pinnavians/Helix Finbird\|helix finbird]], endemic to [[Geography/Icosachores/COAN-SCHELL/Coan/Coan\|Coan]]. Unlike the main species, this subspecies is slightly smaller and heavier, with reduced flight activity.
# Etymology
From English *fin* + *bird*.
# Morphology
The Coan helix finbird has reflective white fur with muted orange wing markings, identical to the parent species. Its pseudofins are translucent, malleable, and shaped to aid in agile hunting maneuvers, while its sharp claws and canines are fully functional for capturing and consuming marpichi. Although slightly heavier and more compact, its body maintains a thin, aerodynamic profile.
# Physiology
Eyes remain highly adapted for long-distance spotting of prey.
## Diet
Preys primarily on [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Marpichi\|marpichi]] along coastal areas.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Reproduction is opportunistic, with 2–4 eggs per litter. Cubs remain immobile for several months, receiving extensive care before becoming independent. Lifespan is comparable to the parent species.
## Social Structure
More sedentary while patrolling its territory compared to the parent species; parental care is provided by the males.
# Ecology
It occupies the same ecological niche as its parent species, nesting atop [[Root Resources/Fungi/Schell Helix\|schell helices]] and, where unavailable, on high coastal cliffs. It plays a critical role in regulating marpichi populations within its restricted range.

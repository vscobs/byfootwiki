The clay nuprae is a stocky, reptilian species found throughout [[Geography/Icosachores/JUNDA/Junda\|Junda]], excluding coastal regions. Preferring small crevices in trees or shallow cave systems, it is a solitary creature.
# Etymology
From English *clay* and Latin *nubes aprica*, meaning “sunny cloud”.
# Morphology
Adults range from 18 to 25 cm in length and 3 to 5 cm in width, with a stocky body covered in terracotta-colored skin. A transparent, cartilaginous spine rises from the back of its head to its tail, reaching approximately one centimeter above the body. Its four limbs end in broad, four-digit paws that resemble small clouds, soft and white. The clay nuprae has small, pitch-black eyes and no sexual dimorphism.
# Physiology
Older individuals display faint white markings and reduced activity, giving them a visibly aged appearance.
## Diet
Its diet consists primarily of small insects, such as [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Families/Featherfly (Ptilopteridae)\|featherflies]] and [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Petalden Mite\|petalden mites]], and it occasionally consumes sungel produced by the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Sungel Featherfly\|sungel featherfly]].
## Specific Abilities
Paws are possibly adapted to trap small animals or plant debris, though the exact function remains unknown.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Individuals mature quickly, reaching full size in just a few months, and typically live for around a year and a half. Reproduction occurs within their sheltering crevices, with eggs laid in protected nooks.
## Social Structure
Clay Nuprae are solitary and relatively sedentary.
# Ecology
They are opportunistic feeders, spending much of their time within crevices or caves.

The dwarf helix is a short-lived cousin of the Schell helix. Rather than growing into monumental towers, it survives by channeling nearly all of its energy into rapid reproduction.
# Etymology
Unknown.
# Morphology
Dwarfs look like miniature versions of the giants: pale, spiraling cones streaked with orange, brown, and green. Mature individuals stand 40 centimeters to 2 meters tall, with fibrous, chalky skins and hollow ledges. Each year they produce multiple “flower-like” structures. These pods remain attached for months, ripening slowly into spore-filled capsules.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
Their nectar is unusually sweet and nutrient-rich, designed to reward visiting animals. When pods ripen, they may burst violently, scattering spores directly onto propagators.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
It rarely survives longer than four years, with most of its growth occurring in the first two. Every year it produces pods.
# Ecology
Its bright, fragrant pods draw in small propagator species, which carry spores across the sandy flats and shallows. It feeds and supports tiny animals while continually renewing the fungal network of the archipelago.

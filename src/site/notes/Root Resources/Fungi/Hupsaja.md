Hupsaja is a crawling blanket fungus that spreads low across rocks and soil in [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]-exposed areas of [[Geography/Icosachores/ROSCOURD-YALIA/Yalia\|Yalia]].
# Etymology
Not specified.
# Morphology
Hupsaja forms thin, mat-like sheets that cling to rock surfaces, resembling a textured blanket. Its surface darkens or blacks when exposed to [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]]. The fungus is firm yet flexible, with subtle folds and ridges that follow the contours of its substrate.
# Physiology
Resists chemical stress from [[Environmental Phenomena/Cafrite Efflux\|cafrite vapors]].
## Mechanisms
Surface darkens when exposed to [[Root Resources/Minerals/Cafrite\|cafrite]].
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Not specified.
# Ecology
Hupsaja spreads via spores and mycelial expansion across exposed surfaces. It forms a critical part of the [[Root Resources/Flora/Bryophytes/Rockmiss\|rockmiss]] symbiosis with [[Root Resources/Flora/Bryophytes/Pebblepip\|Pebblepip]] moss, stabilizing harsh rocky microhabitats. It decomposes organic matter and retains moisture within its mats.

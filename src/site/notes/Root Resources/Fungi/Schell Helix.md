The Schell helix is a long-lived, clonal column formed by a dense fungal matrix that hardens into wood-like matter. Colonies cluster in sandy shallows and rise as monumental cones.
# Etymology
Schell and from English *helix*.
# Morphology
A mature helix resembles both a tree and a fungus: a thick, spiraled trunk that tapers into a blunt crown. Its surface is mainly pale yellow or off-white. The outer skin alternates between smooth chalky layers and fibrous ridges. Rings of chambers and ledges punctuate the spiral. At maturity, the cones display ornate spore-pods that glisten with sticky, sweet gel.
# Physiology
Hardens into wood-like matter.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Colonies grow slowly but persistently, adding less than a meter of height per year. Some giants surpass 30 meters.
## Social Structure
Clonal columns cluster in sandy shallows.
# Ecology
Their hollow chambers and ledges host nesting birds (like the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Pinnavians/Helix Finbird\|helix finbird]]) and ground dwellers (like the [[Root Resources/Fauna/Mammals/Marpichi\|marpichi]]). Helices expand by extending root-like cords underground, by rooting fragments broken off by storms, and by producing sexual spore-pods. The floral stage of the pods attracts animals with its nectar-like gel for spore dispersal.

The giant hupsaja is a tubular fungus that dominates humid microhabitats under rock overhangs and near seepage zones.
# Etymology
Not specified.
# Morphology
This species produces thick, geometric tubular fruiting bodies that are fleshy and upright. The surface is slightly fragrant and constantly damp, often dripping water. Tubes range in color from pale browns to muted yellows, with a robust structure.
# Physiology
Continuously absorbs water and maintains microclimates beneath its tubes.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Fruiting occurs seasonally, with the large tubular bodies persisting for multiple years.
# Ecology
It plays a key ecological role by creating persistent water-retentive structures that support moisture-dependent plants, such as [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Cafer\|cafer]] and [[Root Resources/Flora/Herbophytes/Blanze\|blanze]], and provide drinking or sheltering spots for small fauna. It attracts pollinators like [[Root Resources/Fauna/Arthropods/Esgaian Featherfly\|Esgaian featherflies]].

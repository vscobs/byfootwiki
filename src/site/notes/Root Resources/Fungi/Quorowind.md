The quorowind is a low fungus whose presence reads less as growth than as inscription. It appears in scattered colonies pressed hard against the ground. It inhabits the [[Geography/Icosachores/WINDSWING/Rey Bluffs/Rey Bluffs\|Rey Bluffs]] in [[Geography/Icosachores/WINDSWING/Windswing\|Windswing]].
# Etymology
Not specified.
# Morphology
Quorowind are defined by thick, unified top structures: a squat, ornate mass with repeating radial motifs reminiscent of certain inflorescences. The upper surface is slightly metallic, its burnt-orange pigmentation deepening toward near-umber in creases and folds. The stipe is off-white.
# Physiology
## Mechanisms
Tightly bound morphology minimizes moisture loss and resists erosion. Fused basal plate stabilizes loose soil.
# Behavior
## Life Cycle
Spreads slowly, prioritizing density over range. Colonies expand only when existing structures reach material saturation.
## Social Structure
Colonies spread laterally through shared subterranean tissue, creating the impression of many bodies where there is functionally one.
# Ecology
Quorowind occupy exposed, wind-scoured ground where nutrient input is intermittent. Spore release is close to the ground, relying on passing feet, animals, or dragged materials.

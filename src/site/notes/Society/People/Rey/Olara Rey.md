**Olara Nimmes Rey**, formally known as **High Lady Olara Rey I**, was the 9th and last High Lady of [[Geography/Icosachores/WINDSWING/Windswing\|Windswing]].

Olara's first daughter, [[Society/People/Rey/Cymber Rey\|Cymber Rey]], was born in 844. Cymber was one of the World Heads that signed the [[Society/Politics/Twentyfold Settlement Decree\|Twentyfold Settlement Decree]] in 912.

Olara had another child, [[Society/People/Rey/Tyde Rey\|Tyde Rey]], 28 years after her firstborn daughter. The child was named after his father, [[Society/People/Killes/Tyde Killes\|Tyde Killes]] of [[Geography/Icosachores/COLMETRY/Killesteeth/Killesteeth\|Killesteeth]]. Little is known of the relationship between Olara and Tyde Killes.

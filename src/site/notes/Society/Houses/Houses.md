In the world, a **House** is a social signature. While it grants no legal power, it is the first thing a stranger asks of you. To have no House or Seat is to be a ghost in society.

The people are obsessed with identity and origin. Since these groups aren't political units or military factions, Houses function like libraries of human history.

In casual conversation, people introduce themselves by stating their given and House name(s) and their Seat.
## Naming
Naming conventions are **ambilineal**, meaning that a person's name begins with their given name and then their parents' Houses' names, whereas the last can be either the mother's, father's, or both (hyphenated, though rare because it implies the creation of a new House).
## Seat
A **Seat** is the geographical "anchor" of one's identity and origin.

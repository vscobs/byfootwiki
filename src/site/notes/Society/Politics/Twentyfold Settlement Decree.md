The **Twentyfold Settlement Decree**, also commonly referred to as the **Twentyfold**, was mainly an organizational and political decree that divided all big territories in twenty icosachores and greatly reduced the power of until-then monarchs and leaders.
> “The rulers ratified the Twentyfold Settlement, dividing all lands into twenty regions. No language shall be erased, no lineage forgotten and no customs overridden. The reform promises peace through symmetry, clarity through distance, and pride through origin.”

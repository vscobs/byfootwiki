The **People’s Council** is an annual consultative body of 80 randomly selected working-class citizens, organized internally by place of origin to ensure regional and cultural representation. Members must be over 20 and have at least 8 years of general education in history, language, mathematics, and economy.

The Council meets for **two days once per year** to deliberate on national issues. Its debates and conclusions are formally recorded and transmitted to District Heads, who coordinate the councils and present their consolidated register to the national leadership.

To preserve continuity, twenty members return the following year, balancing institutional memory with rotation. The role of the Council is to surface lived experience, shape public priorities, and require formal acknowledgment by the state.

The Council prevent small shared systems from breaking and does not intend to dictate laws on how the population should live.

The Twentyfold Era (912 onward) is defined by constant peace, making People's Councils lightweight social events more than they are political.
